It mandates the use of internal models to assess all price risks at a high confidence level and requires regular reporting and validation of these models. The regulation also stipulates specific requirements for capturing material price risks, such as credit spread risk and recovery rate volatility, while allowing for dynamic hedging benefits under certain conditions. This framework aims to enhance the risk management practices of financial institutions, ensuring robust oversight and mitigation of potential financial risks[0].\n",
